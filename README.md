remote-despamify
================

This repository contains two scripts that I wrote some time ago to reach out
and remotely "despamify" remote mailboxes using SpamAssassin, without fetching
any mail locally.  Neither has been tested recently and may have suffered
bitrot; I offer them to the world. If anyone expresses an interest, I might
invest some more time in adding documentation.
